# Pycalc
This gui based application is made using python with the help of the module tkinter. 
Some of the features of my calculator are: 
1. It intelligently calculates any expression entered by the user
2. You can also enter your input through the *keyboard*
3. The trigonometric functions return values in *radians*.
